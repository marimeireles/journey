** Journey is not a hiring company and it has no vinculos empregaticios. And the companies will be hiring collaborators as a 3rd party in a contract fashion as in ____. All the arrangements between payment of the collaborator should be done with the organization and the contractor. Journey will provide support for collaborators to set up their own free-lancer entities in case they don't have one.

Journey provides a template for a non-legally binding contract between the organization and the collaborator, or contractor.

We don't guarantee anything but we build a community and we believe in our collaborators.
