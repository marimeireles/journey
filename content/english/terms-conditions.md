Journey is not an employment agency and does not establish formal employment relationships. Organizations will engage collaborators on a contract basis, similar to Outreachy's contract system. All payment arrangements should be made directly between the organization and the contractor. Journey will offer assistance to collaborators in establishing their own freelance entities if they do not already have one.
