### Contributors

Potential contributors apply to Journey and go through a manual review process in which we check whether they meet Journey's requirements. Once they get a green light from us, contributors should reach out to the organizations they're excited to work with and start to put together project proposals based on the ideas those organizations have suggested. Journey contributors spend a few weeks getting acquainted with the community's way of doing things and digging into the codebase. At the same time, they team up with their mentor to map out some awesome milestones for their upcoming collaboration period. Once this period is done contributors should send in their projects and the organizations should decide on which contributors to invite. Journey contributors then spend 12 weeks coding on their projects.

### Organizations

Open source projects apply to be mentor organizations. Once accepted, organizations discuss possible ideas with contributors and choose the proposals they wish to mentor for the summer. They provide mentors to help guide each contributor through the program.

### Mentors

Community members and committers who are already active in the mentor organizations can volunteer to be mentors for contributor projects. Mentors and Journey contributors join forces to set some rad goals for the program period. Having an awesome mentor is a key part of the Journey experience â€“ their guidance and support make all the difference!
